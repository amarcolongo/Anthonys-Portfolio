## My Data Analytics Portfolio  
* [Project 1: My graduate capstone](https://github.com/amarcolongo/Capstone/tree/main)
* For this project I considered if the volume of Bitcoin traded daily had an effect on the daily closing price
* Both linear regression and logistic regression were used in this analysis
